# TrigTracker

TrigTracker is an android app for tracking which trig points you have visited from the UK national parks.

This app uses the google maps API and the Lonewalker database of UK trig points to present a map showing all the trig points in the UK. 

The database of all UK trig points is available here: https://lonewalker.net/trigtable.php

The documentation for the google maps API is available here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/intro
